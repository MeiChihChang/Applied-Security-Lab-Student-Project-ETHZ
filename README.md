# Applied-Security-Lab-Student-Project-ETHZ
Applied Security Lab Student Project @ETHZ

A team project: based on a set of functional and security requirements, they will design and implement a prototypical IT system. In addition, they will conduct a thorough security analysis and devise appropriate security measures for their systems. Finally, they will carry out a technical and conceptual review of another team's system. All project work will be performed in teams and must be properly documented in project reports. At the end of the semester, the teams summarize their work in a short presentation.
